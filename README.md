# SPA_INTERACTIVE_SYSTEM
This interactive system is designed to determine whether a user is eligible to enroll in a course based on their age.  When a user interacts with the system, they are asked to enter their age. The system then checks if the user is a minor (under 18) or an adult (18 or older).
